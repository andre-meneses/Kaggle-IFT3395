## Git Commit Guideline

### Commit Structure
Each commit message should consist of a brief description of the changes made, followed by an optional extended description. Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

### Commit Categories
We have categorized commits into the following types:

- **feat**: A new feature or enhancement.
- **fix**: A bug fix.
- **docs**: Documentation changes.
- **style**: Code style changes (e.g., formatting).
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without new features or bug fixes.
- **test**: Adding or modifying tests.
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, tooling, or other non-feature related changes.

### Commit Message Format
- Start with the commit category in lowercase.
- Use a colon and a space after the category.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "feat: Add data preprocessing").
- Optionally, add an extended description separated by a blank line.
