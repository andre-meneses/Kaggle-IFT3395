## Introduction

## To-do 
**1. Implement Logistic Regression:**
   - [x] Data Preprocessing:
     - [x] Split data into features and labels.
   - [x] Model Building:
     - [x] Implement the logistic regression model.
   - [x] Training:
     - [x] Implement the loss function.
     - [x] Set up the training loop.
       - [x] Perform weight updating during training.
